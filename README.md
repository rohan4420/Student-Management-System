CRUD operation on Student Management System
I have developed a Student Management Service project incorporating a three-layer architecture. This system facilitates CRUD operations for student data and utilizes a comprehensive tech stack, including Java Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. Postman is employed for testing purposes, ensuring the robustness of the application. The user interface is designed with a user-friendly homepage to enhance the overall user experience.

Challenges Faced:

1)HTML File Integration:

Issue: Difficulty incorporating HTML files into the Spring Suite Tool.

Resolution: Installed Eclipse Enterprise Java and Web Developer Tools from the Eclipse Marketplace, resolving the integration issue and allowing seamless inclusion of HTML files.

2)Database Error:

Issue: Encountered a database error during development.

Resolution: Added the line spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update to the application properties file, automating updates to the database schema and effectively resolving the error.

3)User Interface Enhancement:

Request: Desired ready-made homepages for the Student Management Service application.

Action Taken: Sought assistance from CodePen, a platform offering professionally designed and ready-made pages. This expedited the creation of a polished and user-friendly interface for the project.

This project successfully implements a three-layer architecture with CRUD operations for student data, addressing challenges through strategic solutions. The application features a robust tech stack and benefits from the utilization of CodePen for efficient user interface development.
